# Introduction to Functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a task.

Functions are like recipes. They take data or variables, perform a set of tasks on them, and then return the result. The beauty of functions is that they allow us to write a chunk of code once, then we can reuse it over and over without writing the same code over and over.

Take a look at this code:

```html
var calculatorOn = false;

function pressPowerButton() {
  if (calculatorOn) {
    console.log('Calculator turning off.');
    calculatorOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator turning on.');
    calculatorOn = true;
  }
}

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning on.

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning off.

```

This code turns the calculator on if it is currently off, and turns it off if the calculator is currently on.

See if you can figure out how this code works. In the next exercise, we'll walk through it line by line.

# Functions
How does this code work?

```html
var calculatorOn = false;

function pressPowerButton() {
  if (calculatorOn) {
    console.log('Calculator turning off.');
    calculatorOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator turning on.');
    calculatorOn = true;
  }
}

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning on.

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning off.

```

1. On line 1, we have a variable named `<calculatorOn`> set to `<false`>. Our program starts with the calculator in the off position.
2. On line 3, there's a function named `<pressPowerButton`>. Functions follow this syntax:

  • They begin with the JavaScript keyword `<function`>.

  • After `<function`> comes the name of the function. `<pressPowerButton`> is the name of the function. Notice there are no spaces in the name and each new word is capitalized. This is a convention in the JavaScript community called camelCase.

  • After the function's name, comes parentheses `<()>`. We'll learn about these in the next exercise.

  • Finally, the function has a block of code it executes between the curly braces ``<{}>``.

3. Inside the function is an `<if/else`> statement.
4. On the last few lines, we make the function run by writing `<pressPowerButton()>`. This term for this is calling the function. We call it with `<pressPowerButton()>`, and it runs all the code in the block of the function.
5. We executed the code in the block of the function twice without having to write it twice. Functions can make code reusable!

# Parameters
The calculator program should be able to perform a math operation on a number. We should be able to give a calculator a number, have it perform a task on it like multiplication, then print a result.

Currently, we have no way to give a function a number. To do this, we can use parameters. Parameters are variables that we can set when we call the function. For example:
```html
function multiplyByThirteen(inputNumber) {
  console.log(inputNumber * 13);
}

multiplyByThirteen(9);
// Output: 117

```

1. We added `<inputNumber>` within the parentheses of the `<multiplyByThirteen>` function. `<inputNumber>` is a parameter.
2. Inside the `<multiplyByThirteen>` function, we use `<console.log>` to print the `<inputNumber>` by `<13>`.
3. When we call the `<multiplyByThirteen>` function on the last lines, we set the `<inputNumber>` parameter. For instance, `<multiplyByThirteen(9)>` calls the `<multiplyByThirteen>` function, and sets `<inputNumber>` as 9. Then, inside the block of the `<multiplyByThirteen>` function, 9 is multiplied by 13, resulting in 117 printing to the console.
4. Note on terminology: `<inputNumber>` is a parameter, but when we call `<multiplyByThirteen(9)>`, the `<9>` is called an argument. Therefore, arguments are provided when you call a function, and parameters receive arguments as their value. So, `<inputNumber>` is a parameter and its value is the argument 9, since we wrote `<multiplyByThirteen(9)>`.

Parameters let us write logic inside functions that can be modified based on when we call the function, which will help make our functions more flexible.

# arameters II
If we can set one parameter, can we set two?

We can set as many parameters as we'd like by adding them when we declare the function, separated by commas, like this:

```html
function getRemainder(numberOne, numberTwo) {
  console.log(numberOne % numberTwo);
}

getRemainder(365, 27);
// Output: 14
```

1. The `<getRemainder>` function has two parameters: `<numberOne>` and `<numberTwo>`.
2. When we call the `<getRemainder>` function on the last line, we include two numbers as the parameters, also separated by commas. This is referred to as passing in parameters to a function.

  In this case, we are telling the function to assign `<numberOne>` the value of `<365>` and `<numberTwo>` the value of `<27>`. We are passing in `<365>` and `<27>` to the `<getRemainder>` function.
3. When the getRemainder runs, the function knows what `<numberOne>` and `<numberTwo>` equal since we passed in two parameters when we called the function. Therefore it evaluates `<365 % 27>`, which produces the result `<14>`.

By adding multiple parameters, we can build functions that are more flexible. Now the function has two variables that we can define when we call the function.

# return

Using `<console.log>` as the result of a function isn't the best use of a function. The purpose of a function is to take some input, perform some task on that input, then return a result.

To return a result, we can use the `<return>` keyword. Take a look at our function from the last exercise, now re-written slightly:

```html
function getRemainder(numberOne, numberTwo) {
  return numberOne % numberTwo;
}

console.log(getRemainder(365, 27));
// Output: 14
```

1. Instead of using `<console.log>` inside the `<getRemainder>` function, we used the `<return>` keyword. `<>`return will take the result of the math operation and give it back to whatever calls it.
2. On the last line, we called the `<getRemainder>` function inside of a `<console.log>` statement, which outputted the result of `<14>`.
3. This code achieved the same output as before, however now our code is better. Why? If we wanted to use the `<getRemainder>` function in another place in our program, we could without printing the result to the console. `<Using return>` is generally a best practice when writing functions, as it makes your code more maintainable and flexible.


# return II
In the last exercise, we pointed out that using `<return>` makes programs more maintainable and flexible, but how exactly?

When functions `<return>` their value, we can use them together and inside one another. If our calculator needed to have a Celsius to Fahrenheit operation, we could write it with two functions like so:

```html
function multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) {
  return celsius * (9/5);
}

function getFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
}

console.log('The temperature is ' + getFahrenheit(15) + '°F');
// Output: The temperature is 59°F
```

Take a look at the `<getFahrenheit>` function. Inside of its block, we called `<multiplyByNineFifths>` and passed it the degrees in `<celsius>`. The `<multiplyByNineFifths>` function multiplied the `<celsius>` by `<`(9/5)>`. Then it returned its value so the `<getFahrenheit>` function could continue on to add `<32>` to it.

Finally, on the last line, we interpolated the function call within a `<console.log>` statement. This works because `<getFahrenheit>` returns it's value.

We can use functions to section off small bits of logic or tasks, then use them when we need to. Writing functions can help take large and difficult problems and break them into small and manageable problems.

# Review Functions
This unit introduced you to functions.

1. Functions are written to perform a task.
2. Functions take data or variables, perform a set of tasks on them, and then return the result.
3. We can define parameters when calling the function.
4. When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.
5. We can use `<return>` to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.

Great work so far. Next up: Scope! Scope informs us where variables are accessible from within our programs
